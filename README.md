# Advent of Code

My solutions to some of the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) problems.

Solutions are stored per year and language used.

---

If a specific year is attempted, it does not mean that all problems were
attempted, or that both part 1 and part 2 was solved.

The solutions here are not meant to use the best memory structures, or the
best/quickest/most optimal solutions. It is only required that the problem is
solved with a reasonable run-time.
